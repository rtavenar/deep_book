# Deep Learning Basics

**by Romain Tavenard**

This document serves as lecture notes for a course that is taught at
Universit√© de Rennes 2 (France) and EDHEC Lille (France).

The course deals with the basics of neural networks for classification and
regression over tabular data
(including optimization algorithms for multi-layer perceptrons),
convolutional neural networks for image classification
(including notions of transfer learning) and sequence classification /
forecasting.

The labs for this course will use `keras`, hence so will these lecture notes.
